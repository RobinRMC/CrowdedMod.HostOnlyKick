# CrowdedMod.HostOnlyKick
This mod changes the vote-kicking feature in Among Us to only allow the lobby host to kick players.</br>
It was originally created to prevent targetting in big player lobbies, as an extension to [CrowdedMod](https://github.com/CrowdedMods/CrowdedMod), but
it can be used independently.
